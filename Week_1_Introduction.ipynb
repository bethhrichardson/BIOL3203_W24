You've successfully a) located Dr. Richardson's GitHub respository, b) located the correct file for Lab 1, and c) opened the Jupyter notebook on your own Google Drive Colaboratory.\n","\n","If you've never used this format before, it's called a Jupyter Notebook and it's the mechanism by which we'll be storing (and grading) your code for the semester. The labs themselves are adapted from the first four chapters of the open-source textbook Applied Bioinformatics by David A. Hendrix, which can be found [here](https://https://open.oregonstate.education/appliedbioinformatics/). I strongly suggest reading each week's chapter before the lab to get an idea of what you'll be working on. In this course, we will be using two(ish) programming languages; the command-line interface and Python, both of which are found in this textbook. We will also be using a specific Python library called \"BioPython\", which contains a bunch of pre-defined object classes and functions which make working with biological data formats in Python a lot easier.\n","\n","For the first half of the semester, all your work will be completed within the Jupyter notebook interface. For the second half of the semester, you will be interfacing with a remote server run by the Mathematics and Computing department which you will access through the terminal of your computer."],"metadata":{"id":"K0vUqqm5G3Ju"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ryRaBMQqG0jf"},"outputs":[],"source":["##This is what a codeblock looks like in Jupyter Notebooks.
